## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This project automates the provisioning of a private EKS cluster on AWS, along with the deployment of key Kubernetes management and monitoring tools using Terraform and Helm. The infrastructure is designed to be robust, allowing you to easily manage, scale, and monitor your Kubernetes resources.

### Key Features:
- **Private EKS Cluster**: A secure EKS setup running within a private VPC.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated deployment using Terraform, ensuring repeatability and scalability.
- **Helm Integration**: Deployment of ArgoCD, Prometheus, and Grafana using Helm charts.
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured into reusable modules for easier management and customization.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code tool to automate deployment.
- **AWS CLI**: To interact with your AWS account.
- **Kubectl**: Kubernetes command-line tool.
- **Helm**: Kubernetes package manager.

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/eks-terraform-project.git
   cd eks-terraform-project

2. **Deploy VPC and EC2: Run the following commands to deploy the VPC and an EC2 instance**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform validate
   terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars
   terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=variables.tfvars

3. **Deploy EKS Cluster and Tools: After setting up the VPC and EC2, run the following commands to deploy the EKS cluster and tools**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform validate
   terraform plan -var-file=variables.tfvars
   terraform apply -auto-approve -var-file=variables.tfvars

4. **Access Deployed Resources: Use kubectl to interact with your EKS cluster and the deployed tools (ArgoCD, Prometheus, Grafana, etc.).**
